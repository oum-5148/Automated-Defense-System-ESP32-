# Automated-Defense-System-ESP32-
This project simulates a smart automated turret system using an ESP32, designed to detect and respond to intrusions in real time. A servo motor rotates an ultrasonic sensor across a 180Â° field of view to scan the area. Upon detecting an object within a critical range (150 cm), the system halts, triggers an alert through an LED and LCD display, and simulates a firing response. 
# How it works

ðŸ”¹ 180Â° area surveillance using servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor
ðŸ”¹ Real-time object detection within predefined range
ðŸ”¹ Dynamic threat response with visual alerts (LCD + LED)
ðŸ”¹ Continuous scanning algorithm with directional intelligence
ðŸ”¹ Hardware integration (ESP32, SG90 Servo, HC-SR04, I2C LCD)
